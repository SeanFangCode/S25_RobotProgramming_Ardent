I first set the line weight and color to be heavier and black so that the sq
more visible. This is done with the SetPen service, then i turn the turtle to the 
starting position and rotation with RotateAbsolute. I then move the turtle in the x 
direction by 2 with geometry_msg topic. After the move, I turn it again with RotateAbsolute 
in increments of 90 degrees. This is repeated until the turtle is back at the starting 
position, completeing the square.
