Using the set_pen service I changed the path color to black. I then cleared the 
turtle sim window of previously drawn paths by using ros2 service call /clear 
std_srvs/srv/Empty. In order to draw the square I published to the /turtle1/cmd_vel 
topic, and changed the linear and angular values accordingly. I first set the first 
position to 90 degrees and then had it move by 2 and so on until it created a square.
